		<h1>Future Lab Experience</h1>
		<p>From day one, my goal was to dive in, get hands-on, and dive in everything I could about the way IBM works. I wanted to truly understand the big picture—how each project, team and idea fit together. This internship was all about pushing myself to learn, listen and grow in new ways. I came in ready to make the most of every moment, knowing that each experience would be a building block for my future.</p>

                 <p> The "LabBuzz" Newsletter is a platform to showcase the latest achievements, key events and activities of the month. The Marketing team, responsible for planning and execution, consists of five members, including me. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Yasha, one of the senior designers, as we collaborate on gathering information and crafting the design. This experience has given me the chance to contribute ideas, express my opinions, share feedback and see our team’s ideas come to life in each edition.</p>

        <p> From the very beginning, I’ve aimed to be as involved as possible in every collaborative activity, seeking opportunities to both learn and enjoy the process. Working with this fantastic team has been invaluable; they’ve supported me in honing my communication skills—especially in conveying information effectively through the newsletter. I’ve also become more adept at using tools like Figma and Box Cloud and have grown comfortable reaching out to others for feedback and guidance. This experience has truly helped me build both my technical skills and my confidence in connecting with others. </p>

                 <p> The Events Team has provided a fantastic opportunity for me to get involved, meet new people, and actively contribute ideas and feedback. I thoroughly enjoyed organizing the logistics for the three events I assisted with: Paint and Sip, Halloween, and a Picnic. It’s been a rewarding experience to be part of these activities.</p>

        <p> I believe initiatives like these really help everyone feel welcomed and show that the company cares about its employees. Taking time to gather in a more relaxed atmosphere allows everyone to connect and fosters a sense of belonging in the workplace. As an intern, it reassures me that the Future Lab has a dedicated team focused on organizing events for employees, which speaks volumes about the company’s values. </p>

                 <p> I also contributed to the Business Analyst team by illustrating and designing their Business Analysis Learning Pathway, as well as the Design Learning Pathway. They had a previous design so basically i follow up the same still and make it distintive form the others. This was an interesting project, as I gained insight into the various specializations available depending on the chosen certifications. It highlighted how individuals can decide their focus areas or explore different specializations. I also learned about the time frames for completing some of these certifications, adding a valuable perspective to the process.</p>
