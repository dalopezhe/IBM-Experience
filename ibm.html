		<h1>Welcome to my Internship Journey</h1>
		<p>From day one, my goal was to dive in, get hands-on, and dive in everything I could about the way IBM works. I wanted to truly understand the big picture—how each project, team and idea fit together. This internship was all about pushing myself to learn, listen and grow in new ways. I came in ready to make the most of every moment, knowing that each experience would be a building block for my future.</p>
