                 <p> I joined the IBM Woodside Team as a design intern, working on the UX Re-design of an advanced internal application called "RADA". Rada is a comprehensive reporting and data analysis tool for internal projects, centralizing all essential reporting information in one place for easier access and management. 
                
                     I worked closely with a team led by Graham Twingss, who was my main point of contact for questions and guidance throughout the internship, along with four developers based in India. It was also valuable to have daily meetings with the team to discuss project progress and stay aligned on our goals.</p>

            <h3> WEEK 4 </h3>
            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>I officially started my internship with the client in week 4, having completed onboarding and training. My first week on the team was dedicated to understanding the project and how users interact with this complex tool. I have to admit the first month was intense and overwhelming, my initial task was to build low-fidelity prototypes for the redesign of the "Quality Card" section. </p>

            <h2> Prototypes</h2>
            <p>I appreciated the creative freedom Graham Twingss game me, allowing me to design and share ideas openly. He shared his vision, which I worked to represent visually.</p> <p>I created over 100 prototypes throughout my internship, with many iterations not making the final cut. Graham was always supportive, recognising my eagerness to learn and persistence to keep moving forward with each task, rather than focusing solely on speed or perfection.</p>

I transitioned to Figma with the purpose on making the hight fidelity Prototypes.I focused on learning Auto Layout and its role in responsive design. Since Auto Layout is similar to CSS Flexbox, it was somewhat familiar, though still challenging. Fortunately, Aryana and Fabian at Woodside were always there to help whenever I needed guidance. </p>

            <p>This period was focused on building different scenarios, presenting the UX process to developers, and detailing each step for clarity. Among many lessons, one valuable takeaway from working with Graham was his precision and clarity with the developers.</p> <p>As a designer, I didn’t need to deliver a fully responsive or functional design, but Graham encouraged me to perfect the responsiveness in Figma to streamline the developers' work. His emphasis on clarity and direction allowed the team to work more efficiently. </p>

With the design complete and functional, we created a PowerPoint presentation showing the step-by-step process for the Product Owner to present to the team. This was a valuable exercise, allowing me to deepen my understanding of RADA’s workflows and document each step in detail. </p>

In the past weeks, we finalized the design and presented it to the Lead Product, who was pleased with the results. I also began working on a new phase of the Quality Card: the RADA report, a section where users learn how to navigate the application. This process is design within a woodside dashboard. I had to incorporate step-by-step details, screenshots, and clear explanations for the users. </p>

        <p> I feel incredibly fortunate for this experience. From having an impactful project to work on from day one, to being part of an outstanding team with IBMers always willing to help, and having an exceptional mentor in Graham—it’s been truly rewarding. Working in the inspiring Mia Yellagonga facilities has made each day enjoyable and motivating, encouraging both learning and growth. I couldn’t be happier with this opportunity, which has not only enhanced my skills but also contributed significantly to my personal and professional development. </p>
